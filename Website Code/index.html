        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Naoki Izumi, and I am currently a 10th-grade student at The Browning School. I consider myself an active and motivated individual who enjoys balancing academics with extracurricular commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been a competitive swimmer since elementary school, and swimming has played a major role in my life. Managing both schoolwork and a demanding training schedule has taught me valuable skills such as discipline, perseverance, and strong time management.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to athletics, I am actively involved in school clubs at Browning. I am a publisher for <em>The Gryett</em>, Browning’s student newspaper, where I contribute to writing and publication efforts. I am also an active member of the Mock Trial club, where I participate in case analysis and team collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these experiences, I have learned how to commit to multiple responsibilities without sacrificing quality or focus. I am eager to continue developing these skills and look forward to opportunities that will further my education and personal growth.
