        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Naoki Izumi, and I am currently a 10th-grade student at The Browning School.
            I am an active and motivated individual who balances academics with extracurricular
            commitments.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been a competitive swimmer since elementary school. Balancing a demanding
            training schedule with schoolwork has taught me discipline, perseverance, and strong
            time-management skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to athletics, I am involved in school clubs. I am a publisher for
            <em>The Gryett</em>, Browning’s student newspaper, and an active member of the Mock
            Trial club.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through these experiences, I have learned how to manage multiple responsibilities
            while maintaining focus and quality. I look forward to continuing my education and
            personal growth.
